# My Personal Portfolio
## Purpose
Building a personal profile from scratch in order to showcase ability and knowledge to potential employers and companies. This page introduces me, the developer, in search of expanding my knowledge in web-development and progressing my career. This  was challenging yet super satisfying. I learned a ton from styling to position and navigating correctly.
Of course this version of the Markdown will elementary and only the beginning, but it's a foot in the door to displaying an accessible and high-quality profile that attracts employers.
